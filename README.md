# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project explores a dataset of the kickstarter campaigns for our client, to help them understand which month would be the best in terms of suceesful rate to start the campaigns on specific subcategory(For example:theater,plays,musical,etc...)

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help client understand the successful rate of the campaign based on various parents category and subcategory, to help client optimize their campagin by setting different goal,starting campaign on different time of the year on specific catergory to improve sucessful rate.

## Analysis and Challenges

The dataset contains more than 4000 campaign, some of the information provided for each campagin includes id,name,goal,pledged amount,outcomes,country,deadline,category and etc. See image above. 
Further analysis was to break down the parents category into subcategory and focus on analysis one subcategory's sucessful rate in differnt time of the year.

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Base on the graph above, we concludes that, Launching campaign in May to July would have the greatest count of successful among the year. The counts of sucessful compagin reaches the highest point in May and it would start decline till the end of the year.

Launching campgin in december would have about the same count of failed and sucessful campagin, Launching campaign in december is just waste of money for doing so.

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

One conclusion is made about the Outcomes based on Goals (2 pt).

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One of the challenges we may encountered are Excel would poping up"please update value" windows once we enter some invalid string into the formula.
I try to resolve the issue by trying out different "solutions" in the online forum, but all of them failed.
At the end, I schedule an 1 on 1 Tutoring time with our TA to solve the issue. TAs are excellent.

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

## Limitation

## Possible tables/graph that would be useful 
One of the possible table/graph could be comparing the sucessful rate with staff pick and not staff pick, we could easier identify if staff pick would boost the cammpagin to meet the goal, and what's sucessful rate with staff pick campagin.

The other one we could be comparing is the same category sucessful rate in different country. For example, film's sucessful rate in UK is better than US, then we could choose UK to do the film campagin. If US has higher sucessful rate in foods than UK, we could choose US to do the food campagin.
